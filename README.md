# Tavern Sealed League Search

This is a small side project for a magic the gathering sealed league I take part in. This tool aggregates decks from moxfield for league particpants and creates an easy to search interface.

This project is hosted on vercel and supabase for the front and back end respectively.

TSL search is a fairly short form project and there is much to be desired in styling, performance, code quality, testing etc. That said, it was fast to build and got the job done for a small side project.
